**PROJECT SPECIFICATION: Make Your Own Card - Lesson 1**

## Step 1: Draw your Card
Take a piece of paper. Think of someone you’d like to make a card for and sketch out a unique card design. 
It can be a birthday card, mother’s day card, congratulations card, just because card, halloween card, so on.

## Step 2: Take a Picture of the Card
Take a picture of this card. You can use your phone’s camera to do this.

## Step 3: Make your Card
Then make the card, using all of the skills, views and view groups you’ve learned about in Lesson 1. 
Try to make your card in as simple and clear a way as possible, and to avoid using fixed widths or heights.
